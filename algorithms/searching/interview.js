// If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree: BFS

// If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: BFS, because with DFS it will be time consuming

// If the tree is very wide: DFS, because BFS will need too much memory to store the entire tree

// If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree: DFS

// Determining whether a path exists between two nodes: DFS

// Finding the shortest path: BFS
